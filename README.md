Description:

This project calculates the monthly cost of salary between any number of employees you enter into the form. The employees and their information
    is kept within a table that is displayed on the webpage for easy viewing. The total monthly cost is displayed in large font below the table. The math behind the total monthly cost is as follows: employee's annual salary divided by 12, this gives us a dollar amount for an individual month, this value is then set aside and displayed. As more employees are added, this calculation runs again for each new employee added. The result is then added to the value we set aside, also updating the displayed total monthly cost.
